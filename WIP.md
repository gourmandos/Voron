>Note the rk-rearmount with the little 'hook' that holds the Z chain away from the ribbon, only for v2.4  
If ribbon is drooping, use 2x rk-frontmount swivels on X rail, instead of 1 + fence.

Use official references such as [Sherpa_Micro](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/ANNEX-Printer-Firmware/blob/main/Klipper_and_Klipper_Derivatives/Sherpa_Micro/Klipper_Config_Block.txt) when possible

- Virtual Z Endstop:
(When using the probe as the Z endstop)

    Enter ``Z_OFFSET_APPLY_PROBE*``
    This will apply your new offset to your probeâ€™s z_offset.  
    Enter ``SAVE_CONFIG``.
