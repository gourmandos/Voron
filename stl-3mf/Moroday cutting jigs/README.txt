You need to print all 4 jigs.

XXmm represents the starting width of the tape.

To use cut a lenght of foam tape slightly longer than the final lenght you need.
Place the cutting guide on the tape, and insert a craft knife / razer in the slot.
I found a combination of sliding the jig while slightly pullingl the foam worked best to get a clean cut.
Once cut in 1 direction, rotate the jig 180 degrees and cut in the other direction. 
The cut lines should meet up.

Use 24mm_guide first, it will result in a 19mm strip and a 5mm strip

Use 19mm_guide second, it will result in a 14mm strip and a 5mm strip.

Use 14mm_guide third, it will result in a 9mm strip and a 5mm strip.

Finally, use the 9mm_guide, it will result in a 4mm strip and a 5mm strip.
